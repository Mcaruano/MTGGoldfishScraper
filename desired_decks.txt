# This is where you list the URLs for the decks that you'd want to work towards building. The entire point
# of this script is to provide analysis for eventually building into the decks listed here, whether it's
# determining which Budget decks are the best starting points (have the most card overlap), or analyzing
# how many of your currently-owned cards (listed in owned_cards.txt) are used in these decks, as well as
# how much money those cards are worth. I've provided a deck URL as an example below.
# Any line in this file beginning with a "#" will not be parsed.

# Sample decks to test. (Grixis Death deck returned 404 error.)
