# This is where you can list cards that you own so that they can be taken into consideration
# for the final deck reporting. Any line in this file beginning with a "#" will not be parsed.
# Each entry must be in the following format: <quantity> <card_name> (with a SPACE, not a TAB, in between)
# No quotes. No hyphens. Capitalization doesn't matter. I've provided an example for your reference
# of a card that doesn't exist.

# Sample card data to test.
